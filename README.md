# Why use DM helper?

DM helper is intended to be a  helpfull tool for DM's (hence the name) that wants to run a campaign on Discord, featuring some things that i found to be essential during any TTRPG game that I had runned, played or whatched online.

I took inspiration from oter Discord TTRPG bots, such as Avrae, but the main feature of this bot is being open source, so anyone is able to add their own features.

### intended features:
- [x] dice rolls
